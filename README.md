The Smart Grid Lab research team publishes datasets for the public and academia in the public datasets section. 
The motivation of the authors of each dataset is to establish potential new collaborations not only with Czech scientists
but also new collaboratio (https://cenet.vsb.cz/en/departments/smart-grid-laboratory/public-datasets/) with foreign authors of important publications.
Each published dataset is followed by a contact person who will send further details about the published dataset
in case of cooperation. 

Any one he will use this dad set, please cite this article (Jahan S. Ibrahim, Blazek Vojtech, Misak Stanislav, Snasel vaclav, and Prokop Lukas.
