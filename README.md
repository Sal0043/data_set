The Smart Grid Lab research team publishes datasets for the public and academia in the public datasets section. 
The motivation of the authors of each dataset is to establish potential new collaborations not only with Czech scientists
but also new collaborations (https://cenet.vsb.cz/en) with foreign authors of important publications.
Each published dataset is followed by a contact person who will send further details about the published dataset
in case of cooperation. 

Any one who use this data set, please cite the following article (Jahan S. Ibrahim, Blazek Vojtech, Misak Stanislav, Snasel vaclav, and Prokop Lukas. "Forecasting of Power Quality Parameters Based on Meteorological Data in Small-Scale Household Off-Grid Systems." 2022.)
